# Pandas

## What is pandas?

**Python Data Analysis Library**

A powerful library for manipulating data arranged in formats like matricies and data frames. It's arguably the most popular Python library used for data analysis. Pandas aims to provide Python users the same type of functionality as the popular statiscal language, **R**.

## Types of data manipulated in Pandas

### Matrices

A matrix is an data structure where numbers are arranged into rows and columns. They will typically conatin floats __or__ integers, but not both. Matrices are used when you need to perform mathmatical operations between complex data sets.

### Data frames

A data frame is a table-like data structure and can cotain mixed data types (strings, floats, integers, etc.). This is the type of data you're probably used seeing in Excel.

### Pandas has the ability to read in various data formats

- Open a local file using Pandas, usually a CSV file, but could also be a delimited text file (like TSV), Excel, etc

- Open a remote file or database like a CSV or a JSONon a website through a URL or read from a SQL table/database

## Reading in csv files

```
pandas.read_csv()

```



```
